// NPM is a java script package manager. Just like BOWER.
// NPM is used for managing packages needed during the development. 
// Bower is used for managing the client side packages (i.e. packages needed at runtime that help the application work).
// This file lists the packages installed with NPM. If you run the command npm update, it updates all the packages included in this file.
