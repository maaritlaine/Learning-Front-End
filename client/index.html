<!--
    ng-app direcive makes this an angular application.
    Without it none of the bound expressions would be treated as such and would appear on the page as typed,
    eg. {{helloMessage}} instead of the bound version Hello, World!
    If you see your bindings unbound even though you have this directive in place, you probably
    have a mistake somewhere in your code and/or lack proper error handling.

    If you need to show an expression as such an not bind it inside an angular application, mark it with
    ngNonBindable directive.

    Directives manipulate the view. They mark locations for content, specify style for it and watch for user input.
    You can write a directive in four different ways:

    <ng-form></ng-form>
    <div ng-form></div>
    <div class='ng-form'></div>
    //TODO: mikä se neljäs tapa olikaan
   
    There are directives for event handling (mouse event, input changes), for binding text and html,
    for hiding and showing element, for applying style etc.
    ngClick, ngHide/ngShow, ngCloak, ngForm, ngClassEven/ngClassOdd, ngHref, ngSrc, ngRepeat...

    You can also write your own custom-direcives.

    <!--
        ng-view is the spot where the code from different templates (e.g movie.html and movies.html)
        is inserted into. Which content (template) is shown in the view depends on how the user navigates
        (which routes they choose) and how these routes are linked to templates and their controllers.
        Linkin is done in the app.routes.js file. Ultimately, the content in determined by the controller.

        Note that in order to routing to work, you will have to...
        - have the angular-route.js library referenced (cf. <script src="angular-route.js" in index.html).
        - have the ngRoute module imported in you main application module (app.module.js).
        - have the $routeProvider and possibly $routeParams injected into the function where you define your routes.
        - define the routing (link routes with templates and controllers) in app.route.js file.
        - Include the <ng-view></ng-view> tags in the index.html. The closing tag needs to be separate?

        Also this would be legal: <div ng-view></div>
