<!--
    ng-controller value tells which controller is in charge of creating a scope and
    thus passing data and functionality for tje piece of the view in encompasses.
        e.g <div ng-controller="moviesCtrl">

    Here we do not need a ng-controller directive, because we have linked this template
    together with the moviesCtrl in the app.route.js file. We can access the relevant 
    controller through the alias defined in that route.

    moviesCtrl alias control has a variable called movies. Content of that variable is a responsibility
    of the controller and it uses movieService to fill it up with relevant data.

    ng-repeat repeats items in a list. You can sort, filter etc.:
    movie in control.movies | filter:searchText | orderBy:order

<div>
    <dl ng-repeat="movie in control.movies">
        <dt>TITLE:</dt>
        <dd><a ng-href="#/movie/{{movie.id}}">{{movie.title}}</a></dd> TODO: annotaatio nohin linkkeihin risuaidat mitä
